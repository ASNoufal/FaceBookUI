# FaceBook UI

A new Flutter project.

## About this project


This is a Facebook UI project that I created using Flutter. The project is a simple replica of the Facebook app's home screen, which displays a list of posts, photos, and stories from the user's friends and groups.

To create the UI, I used various Flutter widgets such as ListView, Column, Row, and Container to create a layout that closely resembles the Facebook app. I also incorporated different types of widgets such as Text, Image, Icon, and Button to create a more interactive and visually appealing UI.

In addition to building the UI, I also used Dart programming language to retrieve and display data from an API. This allowed me to display real Facebook posts and images on the UI, making the app more dynamic.

Overall, I'm excited about what I've learned from this project, and I'm looking forward to continuing to develop my skills in Flutter and UI design.
